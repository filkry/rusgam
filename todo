+ factor out editing layer
+ refactor DataBucket

Things necessary to start messing around with a game:
    + level data:
        + environment definition/placement
        + define entity types in code and/or data
        + place entity type from edit mode
        + save/load levels
        + menu
    + collision detection:
        + collision resolution
    + lighting
        + define dynamic runtime lights instead of baking into shader
        + static/ambient lighting?

Misc:
+ try out clippy and formatting code Rustically
+ handle WM_PAINT event
+ draw triangle
+ data IO
+ identifier storage (hashed vs string interning)
+ port math library
