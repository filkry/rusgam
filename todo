+ make my own Rc/Weak for my allocators
+ shadow rendering doesn't reflect animation
+ look for uses of SYSTEMALLOCATOR and switch as many as possible to take a passed allocator
+ make a Sync version of SDataBucket
+ move Pools out of collections mod.rs
+ move SMemVec from allocate to collections
+ Port SPool to use SMemVec backing rather than Vec
+ some stuff in model.rs should move into render
+ look for everywhere we wait on a fence and consider what it would take to actually synchronize w/o huge perf overhead
+ search for unwrap() calls and clean up
+ why do I have to drop things in a certain order in SRender? Seems super suspect
+ try out clippy and formatting code Rustically
+ handle WM_PAINT event
+ draw triangle
+ data IO
+ identifier storage (hashed vs string interning)
+ port math library

Things necessary to start messing around with a game:
    + level data:
        + environment definition/placement
        + define entity types in code and/or data
        + place entity type from edit mode
        + save/load levels
        + menu
    + collision detection:
        + collision resolution
    + lighting
        + define dynamic runtime lights instead of baking into shader
        + static/ambient lighting?
